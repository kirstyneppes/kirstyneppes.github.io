         <h2>Thatcher Stories</h2>
         <p>"My most distinct Thatcher memory is Interregnum X, not the moment we won but all the hard work that went into the stupid thing. I was heavily involved in one main competition: Performing Arts (our famous shadow puppets skit). Our performance was only 4 1/2 minutes long but it took DAYS to prepare. About two week before ten thatchers piled into the art room and sat on backless stools for 10 HOURS cutting out those stupid puppets with exacto knives. Each cutout was intricate and required patience and careful cutting. It was awful. By the end, I had callouses and my hand was cramped into a claw (insert Chandler Bing joke).</p>
         <p>Two things made it worth it: first, the fact that I was in a room with nine other amazing women in the trenches with me. We watched Parks and Rec, ate snacks, danced, told stories, etc. Second, the feeling of doing a job well done and knowing the pain, tears, and callouses were worth it because we all felt proud of what we produced.</p>
         <p>Plus, we killed it and got first. Remember that one time where all the lights turned off and people first saw our puppets? I do. Audible silence (yes, I know this is an illegitimate oxymoron but I don't care)."</p>

         <ul>
            <li>Margaret Thatcher may have helped invent soft-serve ice cream. After she graduated from the University of Oxford with a chemistry degree, she worked as a research chemist at a Hammersmith food manufacturer called J. Lyons and Company, and was part of a team tasked with "whipping more air into ice cream." They came up with a kind of "soft" ice cream" that used fewer ingredients and saved money on production costs.</li>
            <li> According to secret files released in Britain in Dec. 2009, she chose the type of gun that the Northern Ireland police force used: An American-made Ruger.</li>
            <li> Turquoise was her favorite color, she told Observer journalist Kenneth Harris in an Oct. 12, 1975, interview.</li>
