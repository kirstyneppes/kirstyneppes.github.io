            <li>Margaret Thatcher may have helped invent soft-serve ice cream. After she graduated from the University of Oxford with a chemistry degree, she worked as a research chemist at a Hammersmith food manufacturer called J. Lyons and Company, and was part of a team tasked with "whipping more air into ice cream." They came up with a kind of "soft" ice cream" that used fewer ingredients and saved money on production costs.</li>
            <li> According to secret files released in Britain in Dec. 2009, she chose the type of gun that the Northern Ireland police force used: An American-made Ruger.</li>
            <li> Turquoise was her favorite color, she told Observer journalist Kenneth Harris in an Oct. 12, 1975, interview.</li>
